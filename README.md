# ZEUS: The Future of Timekeeping 🚀

**UNIX is dead. ZEUS lives.** This package introduces a deterministic, cryptographically verifiable time system designed to replace traditional UNIX timestamps. With ZEUS, developers can generate and validate time hashes, ensuring synchronization across systems without relying on sequential UNIX time.

---

## 🌟 Features

👉 **Deterministic Timestamps** – Generate a unique, cryptographic hash from any timestamp.  
👉 **Epoch-Based Execution** – Set an epoch based on a ZEUS hash for synchronized execution.  
👉 **Decentralized & Immutable** – No single point of failure; timestamp verification is trustless.  
👉 **Backward-Compatible with UNIX** – Convert traditional UNIX time into ZEUS easily.  
👉 **Supports Legacy Systems** – SHA-256 fallback for older systems that can't run Blake3.  
👉 **Ideal for Web3, Smart Contracts, IoT, and Security Applications**

## 🛢️ Installation

```sh
# Using Yarn
yarn add zeus-time

# Using NPM
npm install zeus-time
```

---

## ❤️ Usage

### 🔹 Generate a ZEUS Timestamp
```typescript
import { generateZeusHash } from "zeus-time";

async function generateTimeHash() {
  const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
  const hash = await generateZeusHash(timestamp);
  console.log(`ZEUS Time Hash: ${hash}`);
}

generateTimeHash();
```

### 🔹 Convert UNIX Time to ZEUS Time
```typescript
import { unixToZeus } from "zeus-time";

const unixTime = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
unixToZeus(unixTime).then(hash => {
  console.log(`Converted ZEUS Epoch: ${hash}`);
});
```

### 🔹 Convert ZEUS Back to UNIX Time
```typescript
import { zeusToUnix } from "zeus-time";

const zeusHash = "your_zeus_hash_here";
const unixTime = zeusToUnix(zeusHash);
console.log(`Converted UNIX Time: ${unixTime}`);
```
```
💡 **Note:** `zeusToUnix()` is the primary function for ZEUS time handling. For legacy support, use `legacyZeusToUnix()`.
```

### 🔹 Execute Based on a ZEUS Epoch
```typescript
import { executeAtZeusEpoch } from "zeus-time";

executeAtZeusEpoch(1735689600, () => {
  console.log("Executing synchronized action at ZEUS Epoch!");
});
```

## 🚀 Benchmark Performance
Zeus-Time is **blazing fast!** Recent tests show it can **hash timestamps at record-breaking speeds!** 💥

```bash
Performance Test: Hashed 1000 timestamps in **12ms** ⚡  
Performance Test: Hashed 5000 timestamps in **51ms** ⚡  
Performance Test: Hashed 10,000 timestamps in **98ms** ⚡  
Performance Test: Hashed 50,000 timestamps in **434ms** ⚡  
```

### **Why Use Zeus-Time?**
👉 **Ultra-Fast** - Outperforms traditional UNIX-based hashing.  
👉 **Cryptographically Secure** - Uses BLAKE3 hashing for reliability.  
👉 **Future-Proof** - Designed for next-gen blockchain & AI applications.  

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

👉 **Smart Contracts** – Ensure execution only happens at a predetermined time.  
👉 **Decentralized Networks** – Nodes validate time-sensitive actions without a global clock.  
👉 **Gaming & AI** – Sync in-game events or AI processes based on immutable time hashes.  
👉 **Supply Chain & IoT** – Devices validate time-based triggers securely.  
👉 **File Integrity & Authentication** – Timestamped events are cryptographically secured.  

---

## 🔄 Legacy System Support

ZEUS is designed for modern timekeeping but also supports **legacy systems** with SHA-256 hashing. If Blake3 is unavailable, ZEUS will fall back to SHA-256, ensuring compatibility across older infrastructures.

🏢 **Legacy Function Naming:**  
- `legacyUnixToZeus()` → Converts UNIX to ZEUS hash using SHA-256.  
- `legacyZeusToUnix()` → Attempts UNIX conversion but is not cryptographically reversible.

## 🤡 Test Results

ZEUS has passed all unit tests for functionality, security, and legacy compatibility.

👉 10/10 Tests Passed  
👉 Validates timestamps correctly (Ensures input is formatted and normalized properly)  
👉 Ensures deterministic hashing (Same input always produces the same secure hash)  
👉 Supports legacy SHA-256 fallback (Ensures compatibility with older systems if BLAKE3 is unavailable)  
👉 Prevents invalid time manipulation (Rejects malformed, tampered, or unrealistic timestamps)  
👉 Ensures consistent hash output across formats (Tests Date objects, ISO strings, and UNIX timestamps)  
👉 Handles extreme dates correctly (Validates UNIX epoch and future dates like 2999-12-31)  
👉 Rejects invalid inputs (Throws errors for undefined, null, and malformed timestamps)  
👉 Performance benchmark confirmed (**1000 hashes computed in 12ms**)  

Run tests yourself:

```sh
yarn test
```

## 🔒 Security & Trust

ZEUS ensures **time integrity** without requiring a centralized authority. Hashes are **tamper-proof** and **deterministically generated**, making it impossible to predict or manipulate timestamps in advance.
